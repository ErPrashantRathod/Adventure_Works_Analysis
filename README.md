  ## Data Story
* Adventure Works is a company that sells bicycles, clothing, and accessories in regions like Europe, North America, and the Pacific. To understand how their business is doing, they collected sales data from the past three years. This project brings all that data together and adds useful details like customer age, income, and product categories.

  -The dashboard helps answer questions such as:

  -Where are we selling the most?

  -Which products are the most popular?

  -Who are our main customers?

  -Are we earning good profit?

* Using simple charts and key numbers, the report makes it easier for the company to make smart decisions and grow their business.

   - North America sold a lot of Road-250 bikes, but also had more returns than Europe.

3. Category Breakdown
